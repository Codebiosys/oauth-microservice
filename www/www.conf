# NGINX development suite
#
# This NGINX configuration serves as a simple reverse-proxy to unify all
# services into one convenient endpoint so that the developer doesn't
# have to remember so many ports.
#
# The main application will be available via:
#   /api  API service
#
# Additional development content will be available via the "/sys" endpoint:
#   /sys/api-coverage
#

# Reverse Proxy Host Headers for Django

  # via "/sys" endpoint

  # Serve any static files.
